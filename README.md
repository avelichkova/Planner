# Planner

A custom planner to track your goals and daily tasks. It has a 
  - monthly calendar;
  - an agenda table in which you can type the event, the relevant time slot, whether to show the event on the calendar or not (checkbox) and the current type of event
  - a to-do list for the day with the same properties as the agenda table plus a time property, in which you type the aproximate time the task will take
  - you can set goals for the month for current event type, for example : event/task type "training", amount of time "10 times" and the app will authomatically check it when it's done

Bonus idea: There can be two profiles which can edit the same planner
